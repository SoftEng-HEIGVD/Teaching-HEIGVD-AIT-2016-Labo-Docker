## Lab 04 - Docker


#### Pedagogical objectives

* Build your own Docker images

* Become familiar with lightweight process supervision for Docker

* Understand core concepts for dynamic scaling of an application in production

* Put into practice decentralized management of web server instances

#### Instructions for the lab report

This lab builds on a previous lab on load balancing.

In this lab you will perform a number of tasks and document your progress in a
lab report. Each task specifies one or more deliverables to be produced.
Collect all the deliverables in your lab report. Give the lab report a structure
that mimics the structure of this document.

We expect you to have in your repository (you will get the instructions later
for that) a folder called `report` and a folder called `logs`. Ideally, your
report should be in Markdown format directly in the repository.

The lab consists of 6 tasks and one initial task (the initial task
should be quick if you already completed the lab on load balancing):

0. [Identify issues and install the tools](#task-0)
1. [Add a process supervisor to run several processes](#task-1)
2. [Add a tool to manage membership in the web server cluster](#task-2)
3. [React to membership changes](#task-3)
4. [Use a template engine to easily generate configuration files](#task-4)
5. [Generate a new load balancer configuration when membership changes](#task-5)
6. [Make the load balancer automatically reload the new configuration](#task-6)

**Remarks**:

- In your report reference the task numbers and question numbers of
  this document.

- The version of HAProxy used in this lab is `1.5`. When reading the
  documentation, make sure you are looking at this version. Here is
  the link:
  <http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.5.html>

  **Note**: There is an exception for that later in the lab. The
  documentation for a part of HAProxy (the command line help) is not
  available in 1.5. Therefore, we use the doc for 1.6 which is not
  different for our usage.

- In the report give the URL of the repository that you forked off this lab.

- The images and the web application are a bit different from the lab on load
  balancing. The web app no longer requires a tag. An environment variable
  is defined in the Docker files to specify a role for each image. We will see
  later how to use that.

- We expect, at least, to see in your report:

  - An introduction describing briefly the lab

  - Seven chapters, one for each task (0 to 6)

  - A table of content

  - A chapter named "Difficulties" where you describe the problems you have encountered and
    the solutions you found

  - A conclusion

**DISCLAIMER**: In this lab, we will go through one possible approach
to manage a scalable infrastructure where we can add and remove nodes
without having to rebuild the HAProxy image. This is not the only way
to achieve this goal. If you do some research you will find a lot of
tools and services to achieve the same kind of behavior.


### <a name="task-0"></a>Task 0: Identify issues and install the tools

#### Identify issues

In the previous lab, we built a simple distributed system with a load
balancer and two web applications. The architecture of our distributed
web application is shown in the following diagram:

![Architecture](assets/img/initial-architecture.png)

The two web app containers stand for two web servers. They run a
NodeJS sample application that implements a simple REST API. Each
container exposes TCP port 3000 to receive HTTP requests.

The HAProxy load balancer is listening on TCP port 80 to receive HTTP
requests from users. These requests will be forwarded to and
load-balanced between the web app containers. Additionally it exposes
TCP ports 1936 and 9999 for the stats page and the command-line
interface.

For more details about the web application, take a look to the
[previous lab](https://github.com/SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-AIT-2015-Labo-02).

Now suppose you are working for a big e-tailer like Galaxus or
Zalando. Starting with Black Friday and throughout the holiday season
you see traffic to your web servers increase several times as
customers are looking for and buying presents. In January the traffic
drops back again to normal. You want to be able to add new servers as
the traffic from customers increases and you want to be able to remove
servers as the traffic goes back to normal.

Suppose further that there is an obscure bug in the web application
that the developers haven't been able to understand yet. It makes the
web servers crash unpredictably several times per week. When you
detect that a web server has crashed you kill its container and you
launch a new container.

Suppose further currently your web servers and your load balancer are
deployed like in the previous lab. What are the issues with this
architecture? Answer the following questions. The questions are
numbered from `M1` to `M6` to refer to them later in the lab. Please
give in your report the reference of the question you are answering.

1. <a name="M1"></a>**[M1]** Do you think we can use the current
   solution for a production environment? What are the main problems
   when deploying it in a production environment?

2. <a name="M2"></a>**[M2]** Describe what you need to do to add new
   `webapp` container to the infrastructure. Give the exact steps of
   what you have to do without modifiying the way the things are
   done. Hint: You probably have to modify some configuration and
   script files in a Docker image.

3. <a name="M3"></a>**[M3]** Based on your previous answers, you have
   detected some issues in the current solution. Now propose a better
   approach at a high level.

4. <a name="M4"></a>**[M4]** You probably noticed that the list of web
  application nodes is hardcoded in the load balancer
  configuration. How can we manage the web app nodes in a more dynamic
  fashion?

5. <a name="M5"></a>**[M5]** In the physical or virtual machines of a
   typical infrastructure we tend to have not only one main process
   (like the web server or the load balancer) running, but a few
   additional processes on the side to perform management tasks.

   For example to monitor the distributed system as a whole it is
   common to collect in one centralized place all the logs produced by
   the different machines. Therefore we need a process running on each
   machine that will forward the logs to the central place. (We could
   also imagine a central tool that reaches out to each machine to
   gather the logs. That's a push vs. pull problem.) It is quite
   common to see a push mechanism used for this kind of task.

   Do you think our current solution is able to run additional
   management processes beside the main web server / load balancer
   process in a container? If no, what is missing / required to reach
   the goal? If yes, how to proceed to run for example a log
   forwarding process?

6. <a name="M6"></a>**[M6]** In our current solution, although the
   load balancer configuration is changing dynamically, it doesn't
   follow dynamically the configuration of our distributed system when
   web servers are added or removed. If we take a closer look at the
   `run.sh` script, we see two calls to `sed` which will replace two
   lines in the `haproxy.cfg` configuration file just before we start
   `haproxy`. You clearly see that the configuration file has two
   lines and the script will replace these two lines.

   What happens if we add more web server nodes? Do you think it is
   really dynamic? It's far away from being a dynamic
   configuration. Can you propose a solution to solve this?

#### Install the tools

> In this part of the task you will set up Vagrant with Docker
  containers like in the previous lab. The Docker images are a little
  bit different from the previous lab and we will work with these
  images during this lab.

You should have installed Vagrant already in the previous lab. If not,
download and install from:

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

Fork the following repository and then clone the fork to your machine:
<https://github.com/SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-AIT-2015-Labo-Docker>

To fork the repo, just click on the `Fork` button in the GitHub interface.

Once you have installed everything, start the Vagrant VM from the
project folder with the following command:

```bash
vagrant up
```

This will download an Ubuntu Linux image and initialize a Vagrant
virtual machine with it. Vagrant then runs a provisioning script
inside the VM that installs Docker and creates three Docker
containers. One contains HAProxy, the other two contain each a sample
web application.

The containers with the web application stand for two web servers that
are load-balanced by HAProxy.

The provisioning of the VM and the containers will take several
minutes. You should see output similar to the following:

```
vagrant up
Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==> default: Importing base box 'phusion/ubuntu-14.04-amd64'...
==> default: Matching MAC address for NAT networking...
==> default: Checking if box 'phusion/ubuntu-14.04-amd64' is up to date...
[...]
==> default: Removing intermediate container 4a23f3ea2a27
==> default: Successfully built 69388325f98a
==> default: ************************  run webapps  ************************
==> default: 3fb984306e36090f18e9da5b86c32d2360ad7768a0ab11dff7f9b588c2869e4a
==> default: c845c95bfb48d67625d67367a1a12226a6d35269d26ec452c90b0fd095a29d28
==> default: ************************  run haproxy  ************************
==> default: 5882839613b57e8b97737787a33678116237a80e0643cdd13fb34ac5f9e7d22b
```

There will be occasional error messages from `dpkg-preconfigure`,
`debconf` or `invoke-rc.d`. You can safely ignore them.

When deployment is finished you can log into the VM like so:

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

Once inside the VM you can list the running containers like so:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                NAMES
2b277f0fe8da        softengheigvd/ha       "./run.sh"          21 seconds ago      Up 20 seconds       0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:1936->1936/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9999->9999/tcp   ha
0c7d8ff6562f        softengheigvd/webapp   "./run.sh"          22 seconds ago      Up 21 seconds       3000/tcp                                                             s2
d9a4aa8da49d        softengheigvd/webapp   "./run.sh"          22 seconds ago      Up 21 seconds       3000/tcp                                                             s1
```

You can now navigate to the address of the load balancer <http://192.168.42.42>
in your favorite browser. The load balancer forwards your HTTP request to one
of the web app containers.

**Deliverables**:

1. Take a screenshot of the stats page of HAProxy at
   <http://192.168.42.42:1936>. You should see your backend nodes.

2. Give the URL of your repository URL in the lab report.


### <a name="task-1"></a>Task 1: Add a process supervisor to run several processes

> In this task, we will learn to install a process supervisor that
  will help us to solve the issue presented in the question
  [M5](#M5). Installing a process supervisor gives us the ability to
  run multiple processes at the same time in a Docker environment.

A central tenet of the Docker design is the following principle (which
for some people is a big limitation):

  > One process per container

This means that the designers of Docker assumed that in the normal
case there is only a single process running inside a container. They
designed everything around this principle. Consequently they decided
that that a container is running only if there is a foreground process
running. When the foreground process stops, the container
automatically stops as well.

When you normally run server software like Nginx or Apache, which are
designed to be run as daemons, you run a command to start them. The
command is a foreground process. What happens usually is that this
process then forks a background process (the daemon) and exits. Thus
when you run the command in a container the process starts and right
after stops and your container stops, too.

To avoid this behavior, you need to start your foreground process with
an option to avoid the process to fork a daemon, but continue running
in foreground. In fact, HAProxy starts by default in this "no daemon"
mode.

So, the question is now, how can we run multiple processes inside one
container? The answer involves using an _init system_. An init system
is usually part of an operating system where it manages deamons and
coordinates the boot process. There are many different init systems,
like _init.d_, _systemd_ and _Upstart_. Sometimes they are also called
_process supervisors_.

In this lab, we will use a small init system called `S6`
<http://skarnet.org/software/s6/>.  And more specifically, we will use
the `s6-overlay` scripts
<https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay> which simplify the use
of `S6` in our containers. For more details about the features, see
<https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#features>.

Is this in line with the Docker philosophy? You have a good
explanation of the `s6-overlay` maintainers' viewpoint here:
<https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay#the-docker-way>

The use of a process supervisor will give us the possibility to run
one or more processes at a time in a Docker container. That's just
what we need.

So to add it to your images, you will find `TODO: [S6] Install`
placeholders in the Docker images of [HAProxy](ha/Dockerfile#L11) and
the [web application](webapp/Dockerfile#L16)

Replace the `TODO: [S6] Install` with the following Docker
instruction:

```
# Download and install S6 overlay
RUN curl -sSLo /tmp/s6.tar.gz https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay/releases/download/v1.17.2.0/s6-overlay-amd64.tar.gz \
  && tar xzf /tmp/s6.tar.gz -C / \
  && rm -f /tmp/s6.tar.gz
```

Take the opportunity to change the `MAINTAINER` of the image by your
name and email.  Replace in both Docker files the `TODO: [GEN] Replace
with your name and email`.

To build your images, run the following commands inside your Vagrant
VM instance:

```bash
# Build the haproxy image
cd /vagrant/ha
docker build -t softengheigvd/ha .

# Build the webapp image
cd /vagrant/webapp
docker build -t softengheigvd/webapp .
```

or use the script which do the same for you:

```bash
/vagrant/build-images.sh
```

**References**:

  - [RUN](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/run)
  - [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)

**Remarks**:

  - If you run your containers right now, you will notice that there
    is no difference from the previous state of our images. That is
    normal as we do not have configured anything for `S6` and we do
    not start it in the container.

To start the containers, first you need to stop the current containers and remove
them. You can do that with the following commands:

```bash
# Stop and force to remove the containers
docker rm -f s1 s2 ha

# Start the containers
docker run -d --name s1 softengheigvd/webapp
docker run -d --name s2 softengheigvd/webapp
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 1936:1936 -p 9999:9999 --link s1 --link s2 --name ha softengheigvd/ha
```

or you can use the script to start two base containers:

```bash
/vagrant/start-containers.sh
```

You can check the state of your containers as we already did it in
previous task with `docker ps` which should produce an output similar
to the following:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                NAMES
2b277f0fe8da        softengheigvd/ha       "./run.sh"          21 seconds ago      Up 20 seconds       0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:1936->1936/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9999->9999/tcp   ha
0c7d8ff6562f        softengheigvd/webapp   "./run.sh"          22 seconds ago      Up 21 seconds       3000/tcp                                                             s2
d9a4aa8da49d        softengheigvd/webapp   "./run.sh"          22 seconds ago      Up 21 seconds       3000/tcp                                                             s1
```

**Remarks**:

  - Later in this lab, the two scripts `start-containers.sh` and `build-images.sh`
    will be less relevant. During this lab, we will build and run extensively the `ha`
    proxy image. Become familiar with the docker `build` and `run` commands.

**References**:

  - [docker ps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/)
  - [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)
  - [docker rm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rm/)

We need to configure `S6` as our main process and then replace the
current one. For that we will update our Docker images
[HAProxy](ha/Dockerfile#L47) and the
[web application](webapp/Dockerfile#L38) and replace the: `TODO: [S6]
Replace the following instruction` by the following Docker
instruction:

```
# This will start S6 as our main process in our container
ENTRYPOINT ["/init"]
```

**References**:

  - [ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/entrypoint)

You can build and run the updated images (use the commands already
provided earlier).  As you can observe if you try to go to
http://192.168.42.42, there is nothing live.

It's the expected behavior for now as we just replaced the application
process by the process supervisor one. We have a superb process
supervisor up and running but no more application.

To remedy to this situation, we will prepare the starting scripts for
`S6` and copy them at the right place. Once we do this, they will be
automatically taken into account and our applications will be
available again.

Let's start by creating a folder called `service` in `ha` and `webapp`
folders. You can use the above commands (do this command in your
Vagrant VM):

```bash
mkdir -p /vagrant/ha/services/ha /vagrant/webapp/services/node
```

You should have the following folder structure:

```
|-- Root directory
  |-- ha
    |-- config
    |-- scripts
    |-- services
      |-- ha
    |-- Dockerfile
  |-- webapp
    |-- app
    |-- services
      |-- node
    |-- .dockerignore
    |-- Dockerfile
    |-- run.sh
```

We need to copy the `run.sh` scripts as `run` files in the service
directories.  You can achieve that by the following commands (do these
commands in your Vagrant VM):

```bash
cp /vagrant/ha/scripts/run.sh /vagrant/ha/services/ha/run && chmod +x /vagrant/ha/services/ha/run
cp /vagrant/webapp/scripts/run.sh /vagrant/webapp/services/node/run && chmod +x /vagrant/webapp/services/node/run
```

Once copied, replace the hashbang instruction in both files. Replace
the first line of the `run` script

```bash
#!/bin/sh
```
by:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bash
```

This will instruct `S6` to give the environment variables from the
container to the run script.

The start scripts are ready but now we must copy them to the right
place in the Docker image. In both `ha` and `webapp` Docker files, you
need to add a `COPY` instruction to setup the service correctly.

In `ha` Docker file, you need to replace: `TODO: [S6] Replace the two
following instructions` by

```
# Copy the S6 service and make the run script executable
COPY services/ha /etc/services.d/ha
RUN chmod +x /etc/services.d/ha/run
```

Do the same in the `webapp`Docker file with the following replacement:
`TODO: [S6] Replace the two following instructions` by

```
# Copy the S6 service and make the run script executable
COPY services/node /etc/services.d/node
RUN chmod +x /etc/services.d/node/run
```  

**References**:

  - [COPY](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/copy)
  - [RUN](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/run)

**Remarks**:

  - We can discuss if is is really necessary to do `RUN chmod +x ...` in the
    image creation as we already created the `run` files with `+x` rights. Doing
    so make sure that we will never have issue with copy/paste of the file or
    transferring between unix world and windows world.

Build again your images and run them. If everything is working fine,
you should be able to open http://192.168.42.42 and see the same
content as in the previous task.

**Deliverables**:

1. Take a screenshot of the stats page of HAProxy at
   <http://192.168.42.42:1936>. You should see your backend nodes. It
   should be really similar to the screenshot of the previous task.

2. Describe your difficulties for this task and your understanding of
   what is happening during this task. Explain in your own words why
   are we installing a process supervisor. Do not hesitate to do more
   research and to find more articles on that topic to illustrate the
   problem.


### <a name="task-2"></a>Task 2: Add a tool to manage membership in the web server cluster

> Installing a cluster membership management tool will help us to
  solve the problem we detected in [M4](#M4). In fact, we will start
  to use what we put in place with the solution to issue [M5](#M5). We
  will build two images with our process supervisor running the
  cluster membership management tool `Serf`.

In this task, we will focus on how to make our infrastructure more
flexible so that we can dynamically add and remove web servers. To
achieve this goal, we will use a tool that allows each node to know
which other nodes exist at any given time.

We will use `Serf` for this. You can read more about this tool at
<https://www.serf.io/>.

The idea is that each container will have a _Serf agent_ running on
it, the webapp containers and the load balancer container. The Serf
agents talk to each other using a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol
to exchange information. They form a cluster of nodes. The main
information they exchange is the existence of nodes in the cluster and
what their IP addresses are. When a node appears or disappears the
Serf agents tell each other about the event. When the information
arrives at the load balancer we will be able to react accordingly. A
Serf agents can trigger the execution of local scripts when it
receives an event.

So in summary, in our infrastructure, we want the following:

1. Start our load balancer (HAProxy) and let it stay alive forever (or
   at least for the longest uptime as possible).

2. Start one or more backend nodes at any time after the load balancer
   has been started.

3. Make sure the load balancer knows about the nodes that appear and
   the nodes that disappear. We want to be able to react when a new
   web server becomes online or disappears and reconfigure the load
   balancer based on the current state of our web server topology.

In theory this seems quite clear and easy but to achieve everything,
there remain a few steps to be done before we are ready. So we will
start in this task by installing `Serf` and see how it is working with
simple events and triggers, without changing yet the load balancer
configuration. The tasks 3 to 6 will deal the latter part.

To install `Serf` we have to add the following Docker instruction in
the `ha` and `webapp` Docker files. Replace the line `TODO: [Serf]
Install` in [ha/Dockerfile](ha/Dockerfile#L13) and
[webapp/Dockerfile](webapp/Dockerfile#L18) with the following
instruction:

```
# Install serf (for decentralized cluster membership: https://www.serf.io/)
RUN mkdir /opt/bin \
    && curl -sSLo /tmp/serf.gz https://releases.hashicorp.com/serf/0.7.0/serf_0.7.0_linux_amd64.zip \
    && gunzip -c /tmp/serf.gz > /opt/bin/serf \
    && chmod 755 /opt/bin/serf \
    && rm -f /tmp/serf.gz
```

You can build your images as we did in the previous task. As expected,
nothing new is happening when we run our updated images. `Serf` will
not start before we add the proper service into `S6`. The next steps
will allow us to have the following containers:

```
HAProxy container
  S6 process
    -> HAProxy process
    -> Serf process

WebApp containers
  S6 process
    -> NodeJS process
    -> Serf process
```

Each container will run a `S6` main process with, at least, two
processes that are our application processes and `Serf` processes.

To start `Serf`, we need to create the proper service for `S6`. Let's
do that with the creation of the service folder in `ha/services` and
`webapp/services`. Use the following command to do that (run this
command in your Vagrant VM).

```bash
mkdir /vagrant/ha/services/serf /vagrant/webapp/services/serf
```

You should have the following folders structure:

```
|-- Root directory
  |-- ha
    |-- config
    |-- scripts
    |-- services
      |-- ha
      |-- serf
    |-- Dockerfile
  |-- webapp
    |-- app
    |-- services
      |-- node
      |-- serf
    |-- .dockerignore
    |-- Dockerfile
    |-- run.sh
```

In each directory, create an executable file called `run`. You can
achieve that by the following commands:

```bash
touch /vagrant/ha/services/serf/run && chmod +x /vagrant/ha/services/serf/run
touch /vagrant/webapp/services/serf/run && chmod +x /vagrant/webapp/services/serf/run
```

In the `ha/services/serf/run` file, add the following script. This
will start and enable the capabilities of `Serf` on the load
balancer. You can ignore the tricky part of the script about process
management. You can look at the comments and ask us fore more info if
you are interested.

The principal part between `SERF START` and `SERF END` is the command
we prepare to run the serf agent.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bash

# S6 expects the processes it manages to stop when it sends them a SIGTERM signal.
# The Serf agent does not stop properly when receiving a SIGTERM signal.
#
# Therefore, we need to do some tricks to remedy the situation. We need to
# "simulate" the handling of SIGTERM in the script and send to Serf the signal
# that makes it quit (SIGINT).
#
# Basically we need to do the following:
# 1. Keep track of the process id (PID) of Serf Agent
# 2. Catch the SIGTERM from S6 and send a SIGINT to Serf
# 3. Make sure this shell script will not stop before S6 stops it, but when
#    SIGTERM is sent, we need to stop everything.

# Get the current process ID to avoid killing an unwanted process
pid=$$

# Define a function to kill the Serf process as Serf does not accept SIGTERM. In
# place, we will send a SIGINT signal to the process to stop it correctly.

  kill -INT $pid
}

# Trap the SIGTERM and in place run the function that will kill the process

```

Let's take the time to analyze the `Serf` agent command. We launch the
`Serf` agent with the command:

```bash
serf agent
```

Next, we append to the command the way to join a specific `Serf` cluster where the
address of the cluster is `ha`. In fact, our `ha` node will act as a sort of master
node but as we are in a decentralized architecture, it can be any of the nodes with
a `Serf` agent.

For example, if we start `ha` first, then `s2` and finally `s1`, we can imagine
that `ha` will connect to itself as it is the first one. Then, `s2` will
reference to `ha` to be in the same cluster and finally `s1` can reference `s2`.
Therefore, `s1` will join the same cluster than `s2` and `ha` but through `s2`.

For simplicity, all our nodes will register to the same cluster trough the `ha`
node.

```bash
--join ha
```

**Remarks**:

  - Once the cluster is created in `Serf` agent, the first node which created
    the `Serf` cluster can leave the cluster. In fact, leaving the cluster will
    not stop it as long as the `Serf` agent is running.

    Anyway, in our current solution, there is kind of misconception around the
    way we create the `Serf` cluster. In the deliverables, describe which
    problem exists with the current solution based on the previous explanations and
    remarks. Propose a solution to solve the issue.

To make sure that `ha` load balancer can leave and enter the cluster again, we add
the `--replay` option. This will make the Serf agent replay the past events and then react to
these events. In fact, due to the problem you have to guess, this will probably not
be really useful.

```bash
--replay
```

Then we append the event handlers to react to some events.

```bash
--event-handler member-join=/serf-handlers/member-join.sh
--event-handler member-leave,member-failed=/serf-handlers/member-leave.sh
```

At the moment the `member-join` and `member-leave` scripts are missing. We will add
them in a moment. These two scripts will manage the load balancer configuration.

And finally, we set a tag `role=<rolename>` to our load balancer. The `$ROLE` is
the environment variable that we have in the Docker files. With the role, we will
be able to differentiate between the `balancer` and the `backend` nodes.

```bash
--tag role=$ROLE
```

In fact, each node that will join or leave the `Serf` cluster will trigger a `join`,
respectively `leave` events. It means that the handler scripts on the `ha` node
will be called for all the nodes, including itself. We want to avoid reconfiguring
`ha` proxy when itself `join`s or `leave`s the `Serf` cluster.

**References**:

  - [Serf agent](https://www.serf.io/docs/agent/basics.html)
  - [Event handlers](https://www.serf.io/docs/agent/event-handlers.html)
  - [Serf agent configuration](https://www.serf.io/docs/agent/options.html)
  - [Join -replay](https://www.serf.io/docs/commands/join.html#_replay)

Let's prepare the same kind of configuration. Copy the `run` file you just created
in `webapp/services/serf` and replace the content between `SERF START` and `SERF END`
by the following one:

```bash
# We build the Serf command to run the agent
COMMAND="/opt/bin/serf agent"
COMMAND="$COMMAND --join ha"
COMMAND="$COMMAND --tag role=$ROLE"
```

This time, we do not need to have event handlers for the backend nodes. The
backend nodes will just appear and disappear at some point in time and
nothing else. The `$ROLE` is also replaced by the `-e "ROLE=backend"` from
the Docker `run` command.

Again, we need to update our Docker images to add the `Serf` service to `S6`.

In both Docker image files, in the [ha](ha) and [webapp](webapp) folders,
replace `TODO: [Serf] Add Serf S6 setup` with the instruction to copy the
Serf agent run script and to make it executable.

And finally, you can expose the `Serf` ports through your Docker image files. Replace
the `TODO: [Serf] Expose ports` by the following content:

```
# Expose the ports for Serf
EXPOSE 7946 7373
```

**References**:

  - [EXPOSE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/expose)

It's time to build the images and to run the containers. You can use the provided scripts
or run the command manually. At this stage, you should have your application running as the
`Serf` agents. To ensure that, you can access http://192.168.42.42 to see if you backends
are responding and you can check the Docker logs to see what is happening. Simply run:

```bash
docker logs <container name>
```

where container name is one of:

  - ha
  - s1
  - s2

**Remarks**:

  - When we reach this point, we have a problem. If we start the HAProxy first,
    it will not start as the two `s1` and `s2` containers are not started and we
    try to link them through the Docker `run` command.

    You can try and get the logs. You will see error logs where `s1` and `s2`

    If we start `s1` and `s2` nodes before `ha`, we will have an error from `Serf`.
    They try to connect the `Serf` cluster via `ha` container which is not running.

    So the reverse proxy is not working but what we can do at least is to start
    the containers beginning by `ha` and then backend nodes. It will make the `Serf`
    part working and that's what we are working on at the moment and in the next
    task.

  - [Embedded DNS server in user-defined networks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/configure-dns/)
  - [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)

**Cleanup**:

  - As we have changed the way we start our reverse proxy and web application, we
    can remove the original `run.sh` scripts. You can use the following commands to
    clean these two files (and folder in case of web application).

    ```bash
    rm /vagrant/ha/scripts/run.sh
    rm -r /vagrant/webapp/scripts
    ```

**Deliverables**:

1. Provide the docker log output for each of the containers: `ha`,
   `s1` and `s2`. You need to create a folder `logs` in your
   repository to store the files separately from the lab
   report. For each lab task create a folder and name it using the
   task number. No need to create a folder when there are no logs.

   Example:

   ```
   |-- root folder
     |-- logs
       |-- task 1
       |-- task 3
       |-- ...
   ```

2. Give the answer to the question about the existing problem with the
   current solution.

3. Give an explanation on how `Serf` is working. Read the official
   website to get more details about the `GOSSIP` protocol used in
   `Serf`. Try to find other solutions that can be used to solve
   similar situations where we need some auto-discovery mechanism.


### <a name="task-3"></a>Task 3: React to membership changes

> Serf is really simple to use as it lets the user write their own shell
  scripts to react to the cluster events. In this task we will
  write the first bits and pieces of the handler scripts we need to build our solution.
  We will start by just logging members that join the cluster and the members
  that leave the cluster. We are preparing to solve concretely the issue
  discovered in [M4](#M4).

We reached a state where we have nearly all the pieces in place to make the infrastructure
really dynamic. At the moment, we are missing the scripts that will react to the events
reported by `Serf`, namely member `leave` or member `join`.

We will start by creating the scripts in [ha/scripts](ha/scripts). So create two files in
this directory and set them as executable. You can use these commands:

```bash
touch /vagrant/ha/scripts/member-join.sh && chmod +x /vagrant/ha/scripts/member-join.sh
touch /vagrant/ha/scripts/member-leave.sh && chmod +x /vagrant/ha/scripts/member-leave.sh
```

In the `member-join.sh` script, put the following content:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "Member join script triggered" >> /var/log/serf.log

# We iterate over stdin
while read -a values; do
  # We extract the hostname, the ip, the role of each line and the tags
  HOSTNAME=${values[0]}
  HOSTIP=${values[1]}
  HOSTROLE=${values[2]}
  HOSTTAGS=${values[3]}

  echo "Member join event received from: $HOSTNAME with role $HOSTROLE" >> /var/log/serf.log
done
```

Do the same for the `member-leave.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "Member leave/join script triggered" >> /var/log/serf.log

# We iterate over stdin
while read -a values; do
  # We extract the hostname, the ip, the role of each line and the tags
  HOSTNAME=${values[0]}
  HOSTIP=${values[1]}
  HOSTROLE=${values[2]}
  HOSTTAGS=${values[3]}

  echo "Member $SERF_EVENT event received from: $HOSTNAME with role $HOSTROLE" >> /var/log/serf.log
done
```

We have to update our Docker file for `ha` node. Replace the
`TODO: [Serf] Copy events handler scripts` with appropriate content to:

  1. Make sure there is a directory `/serf-handlers`.
  2. The `member-join` and `member-leave` scripts are placed in this folder.
  3. Both of the scripts are executable.

Stop all your containers to have a fresh state:

```bash
docker rm -f ha s1 s2
```

Now, build your `ha` image:

```bash
# Build the haproxy image
cd /vagrant/ha
docker build -t softengheigvd/ha .
```

From now on, we will ask you to systematically keep the logs and copy
them into your repository as a lab deliverable.  Whenever you see the
notice (**keep logs**) after a command, copy the logs into the
repository.

Run the `ha` container first and capture the logs with `docker logs` (**keep the logs**).

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 1936:1936 -p 9999:9999 --network heig --name ha softengheigvd/ha
```

Now, run one of the two backend containers and capture the logs (**keep the logs**). Shortly after
starting the container capture also the logs of the `ha` node (**keep the logs**).

```bash
docker run -d --network heig --name s1 softengheigvd/webapp
docker run -d --network heig --name s2 softengheigvd/webapp
```

**Remarks**:

  - You probably noticed that we removed the `links` to container `s1` and `s2`.
    The reason is that we will not rely on that mechanism for the next steps. For
    the moment the communication between the reverse proxy and the backend
    nodes is broken.

Once started, get the logs (**keep the logs**) of the backend container.

To check there is something happening on the node `ha` you will need to connect
to the running container to gather the custom log file that is created in the
handler scripts. For that, use the following command to connect to `ha`
container in interactive mode.

```bash
docker exec -ti ha /bin/bash
```

**References**:

  - [docker exec](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/)

Once done, you can simply run the following command. This command is run inside
the running `ha` container. (**keep the logs**)

```bash
cat /var/log/serf.log
```

Once you have finished, you have simply to type `exit` in the container to quit
your shell session and at the same time the container. The container itself will
continue to run.

**Deliverables**:

1. Provide the docker log output for each of the containers:  `ha`, `s1` and `s2`.
   Put your logs in the `logs` directory you created in the previous task.

3. Provide the logs from the `ha` container gathered directly from the `/var/log/serf.log`
   file present in the container. Put the logs in the `logs` directory in your repo.


### <a name="task-4"></a>Task 4: Use a template engine to easily generate configuration files

> We have to generate a new configuration file for the load balancer each time 
  a web server is added or removed. There are several ways to do this. Here we 
  choose to go the way of templates. In this task we will put in place a
  template engine and use it with a basic example. You will not become an expert
  in template engines but it will give you a taste of how to apply this technique
  which is often used in other contexts (like web templates, mail templates, ...).
  We will be able to solve the issue raised in [M6](#M6).

There are several ways to generate a configuration file from variables
in a dynamic fashion. In this lab we decided to use `NodeJS` and
`Handlebars` for the template engine.

According to Wikipedia:

  > A template engine is a software designed to combine one or more templates
    with a data model to produce one or more result documents

In our case our template is the `HAProxy` configuration file in which
we put placeholders written in the template language. Our data model
is the data provided by the handler scripts of `Serf`. And the
resulting document coming out of the template engine is a
configuration file that HA proxy can understand where the placeholders
have been replaced with the data.

**References**:

  - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
  - [Template Engine definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor)

To be able to use `Handlebars` as a template engine in our `ha`
container, we need to install `NodeJS` and `Handlebars`.

To install `NodeJS`, just replace `TODO: [HB] Install NodeJS` by the
following content:

```
# Install NodeJS
RUN curl -sSLo /tmp/node.tar.xz https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.4.4/node-v4.4.4-linux-x64.tar.xz \
  && tar -C /usr/local --strip-components 1 -xf /tmp/node.tar.xz \
  && rm -f /tmp/node.tar.xz
```

We also need to update the base tools installed in the image to be
able to extract the `NodeJS` archive. So we need to add `xz-utils` to
the `apt-get install` present above the line `TODO: [HB] Update to
install required tool to install NodeJS`.

**Remarks**:

  - You probably noticed that we have the webapp image with a `NodeJS`
    application.  So the image already contains `NodeJS`. We have
    based our backend image on an existing image that provides an
    installation of `NodeJS`. In our `ha` image, we take a shortcut
    and do a manual installation of `NodeJS`.

    This manual install has at least one bad practice: In the original
    image of `NodeJS` they download of the required files and then
    check the downloads against a `GPG` signatures. We have skipped
    this part in our `ha`image, but in practice you should check every
    download to avoid issues like the `man in the middle` attack.

    You can take a look at the following links if you are interested
    in this topic:

      - [NodeJS official Dockerfile](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/ae9e2d4f04a0fa82261df86fd9556a76cefc020d/6.3/wheezy/Dockerfile#L4-L26)
      - [GPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard)
      - [Man in the middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)

    The other reason why we have to manually install `NodeJS` is that
    we cannot inherit from two images at the same time. As in our `ha`
    image we already inherit `FROM` the `haproxy` official image we
    cannot use the `NodeJS` image at the same time.

    In fact, the `FROM` instruction from Docker works like the Java
    inheritance model. You can inherit only from one super class at a
    time. For example, we have the following hierarchy for our HAProxy
    image.

    <a href="https://github.com/SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-AIT-2016-Labo-Docker/blob/master/assets/img/image-hierarchy.png">
      <img src="https://github.com/SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-HEIGVD-AIT-2016-Labo-Docker/raw/master/assets/img/image-hierarchy.png" alt="HAProxy Image Hierarchy" width="600">
    </a>

    Here is the reference to the Docker documentation of the `FROM` command:

      - [FROM](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/from)

It's time to install `Handlebars` and a small command line tool
`handlebars-cmd` to make it work properly. For that replace the `TODO:
[HB] Install Handlebars and cli` by this Docker instruction:

```
# Install the handlebars-cmd node module and its dependencies
RUN npm install -g handlebars-cmd
```

**Remarks**:

  - [NPM](http://npmjs.org/) is a package manager for `NodeJS`. Like
    other package managers, one of its tasks is to manage the
    dependencies of a package. That's the reason why we have to
    install only `handlebars-cmd`. This package has the `handlebars`
    package as one of its dependencies.

Now we will update the handler scripts to use `Handlebars`. For the moment, we
will just play with a simple template. So, first create a file in `ha/config` called
`haproxy.cfg.hb` with a simple template content. Use the following command for that:

```bash
echo "Container {{ name }} has joined the Serf cluster with the following IP address: {{ ip }}" >> /vagrant/ha/config/haproxy.cfg.hb
```

We need our template present in our `ha` image. We have to add the following
Docker instructions for that. Let's replace `TODO: [HB] Copy the haproxy configuration template`
in [ha/Dockerfile](ha/Dockerfile#L32) with the required stuff to:

  1. Have a directory `/config`
  2. Have the `haproxy.cfg.hb` in it

Then, update the `member-join.sh` script in [ha/scripts](ha/scripts) with the following content:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "Member join script triggered" >> /var/log/serf.log

# We iterate over stdin
while read -a values; do
  # We extract the hostname, the ip, the role of each line and the tags
  HOSTNAME=${values[0]}
  HOSTIP=${values[1]}
  HOSTROLE=${values[2]}
  HOSTTAGS=${values[3]}

  echo "Member join event received from: $HOSTNAME with role $HOSTROLE" >> /var/log/serf.log

  # Generate the output file based on the template with the parameters as input for placeholders
  handlebars --name $HOSTNAME --ip $HOSTIP < /config/haproxy.cfg.hb > /tmp/haproxy.cfg
done
```

<a name="ttb"></a>
Time to build our `ha` image and run it. We will also run `s1` and `s2`. As usual, here
are the commands to build and run our image and containers:

```bash
# Remove running containers
docker rm -f ha s1 s2

# Build the haproxy image
cd /vagrant/ha
docker build -t softengheigvd/ha .

# Run the HAProxy container
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 1936:1936 -p 9999:9999 --network heig --name ha softengheigvd/ha
```

**Remarks**:

  - Installing a new util with `apt-get` means building the whole image again as
    it is in our Docker file. This will take few minutes.

Take the time to retrieve the output file in the `ha` container. Connect to the container:

```bash
docker exec -ti ha /bin/bash
```

and get the content from the file (**keep it for deliverables, handle it as you do for the logs**)

```bash
cat /tmp/haproxy.cfg
```

**Remarks**:

  - It can be really convenient to have two or more terminals open in
    parallel with a ssh session to your Vagrant VM. With multiple
    sessions you can keep your connection to `ha` container alive
    while you start your backend nodes.

    To open another ssh session to Vagrant, simply run `vagrant ssh`
    in the root directory of your repository from another terminal
    tab/window.

After you have inspected the generated file quit the container with `exit`.

Now that we invoke the template engine from the handler script it is
time to do an end-to-end test. Start the `s1` container, wait a bit,
then retrieve the `haproxy.cfg` file from the `ha` container to see
whether it saw `s1` coming up. Then do the same for `s2`:

```bash
# 1) Run the S1 container
docker run -d --network heig --name s1 softengheigvd/webapp

# 2) Connect to the ha container (optional if you have another ssh session)
docker exec -ti ha /bin/bash

# 3) From the container, extract the content (keep it for deliverables)
cat /tmp/haproxy.cfg

# 4) Quit the ha container (optional if you have another ssh session)
exit

# 5) Run the S2 container
docker run -d --network heig --name s2 softengheigvd/webapp

# 6) Connect to the ha container (optional if you have another ssh session)
docker exec -ti ha /bin/bash

# 7) From the container, extract the content (keep it for deliverables)
cat /tmp/haproxy.cfg

# 8) Quit the ha container
exit
```

**Deliverables**:

1. You probably noticed when we added `xz-utils`, we have to rebuild
   the whole image which took some time. What can we do to mitigate
   that? Take a look at the Docker documentation on
   [image layers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/#images-and-layers).
   Tell us about the pros and cons to merge as much as possible of the
   command. In other words, compare:

  ```
  RUN command 1
  RUN command 2
  RUN command 3
  ```

  vs.

  ```
  RUN command 1 && command 2 && command 3
  ```

  There are also some articles about techniques to reduce the image
  size. Try to find them. They are talking about `squashing` or
  `flattening` images.

2. Propose a different approach to architecture our images to be able
   to reuse as much as possible what we have done. Your proposition
   should also try to avoid as much as possible repetitions between
   your images.

3. Provide the `/tmp/haproxy.cfg` file generated in the `ha` container
   after each step.  Place the output into the `logs` folder like you
   already did for the Docker logs in the previous tasks. Three files
   are expected.
   
   In addition, provide a log file containing the output of the 
   `docker ps` console and another file (per container) with
   `docker inspect <container>`. Four files are expected.
   
4. Based on the three output files you have collected, what can you
   say about the way we generate it? What is the problem if any?


### <a name="task-5"></a>Task 5: Generate a new load balancer configuration when membership changes

> We now have S6 and Serf ready in our HAProxy image. We have member
  join/leave handler scripts and we have the handlebars template
  engine. So we have all the pieces ready to generate the HAProxy
  configuration dynamically. We will update our handler scripts to
  manage the list of nodes and to generate the HAProxy configuration
  each time the cluster has a member leave/join event.  The work in
  this task will let us solve the problem mentioned in [M4](#M4).

At this stage, we have:

  - Two images with `S6` process supervisor that starts a Serf agent
    and an "application" (HAProxy or Node web app).

  - The `ha` image contains the required stuff to react to `Serf`
    events when a container joins or leaves the `Serf` cluster.

  - A template engine in the `ha` image is ready to be used to
    generate the HAProxy configuration file.

Now, we need to refine our `join` and `leave` scripts to generate a
proper HAProxy configuration file.

First, we will copy/paste the content of the
[ha/config/haproxy.cfg](ha/config/haproxy.cfg) file into the template
[ha/config/haproxy.cfg.hb](ha/config/haproxy.cfg.hb). You can simply
run the following command:

```bash
cp /vagrant/ha/config/haproxy.cfg /vagrant/ha/config/haproxy.cfg.hb
```

Then we will replace the content between `# HANDLEBARS START` and
`# HANDLEBARS STOP` by the following content:

```
{{#each addresses}}
server {{ host }} {{ ip }}:3000 check
{{/each}}
```

**Remarks**:

  - `each` iterates over a collection of data

  - `{{` and `}}` are the bars that will be interpreted by `handlebars`

  - `host` and `ip` are the data contained in the JSON format of the collection
    that handlebars will receive. We will see that right after in the `member-join.sh`
    script. The JSON format will be: `{ "host": "<hostname>", "ip": "<ip address>" }`.

Our configuration template is ready. Let's update the `member-join.sh` script to
generate the correct configuration.

The mechanism to manage the `join` and `leave` events is the following:

  1. We check if the event comes from a backend node (the role is used).

  2. We create a file with the hostname and IP address of each backend
     node that joins the cluster.

  3. We build the `handlebars` command to generate the new configuration from the list
     of files that represent our backend nodes

The same logic also applies when a node leaves the cluster. In this
case, the second step will remove the file with the node data.

In the file [ha/scripts/member-join.sh](ha/scripts/member-join.sh)
replace the whole content by the following one. Take the time to read the comments.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "Member join script triggered" >> /var/log/serf.log

BACKEND_REGISTERED=false

# We iterate over stdin
while read -a values; do
  # We extract the hostname, the ip, the role of each line and the tags
  HOSTNAME=${values[0]}
  HOSTIP=${values[1]}
  HOSTROLE=${values[2]}
  HOSTTAGS=${values[3]}

  # We only register the backend nodes
  if [[ "$HOSTROLE" == "backend" ]]; then
    echo "Member join event received from: $HOSTNAME with role $HOSTROLE" >> /var/log/serf.log

    # We simply register the backend IP and hostname in a file in /nodes
    # with the hostname for the file name
    echo "$HOSTNAME $HOSTIP" > /nodes/$HOSTNAME

    # We have at least one new node registered
    BACKEND_REGISTERED=true
  fi
done

# We only update the HAProxy configuration if we have at least one new  backend node
if [[ "$BACKEND_REGISTERED" = true ]]; then
  # To build the collection of nodes
  HOSTS=""

  # We iterate over each backend node registered
  for hostfile in $(ls /nodes); do
    # We convert the content of the backend node file to a JSON format: { "host": "<hostname>", "ip": "<ip address>" }
    CURRENT_HOST=`cat /nodes/$hostfile | awk '{ print "{\"host\":\"" $1 "\",\"ip\":\"" $2 "\"}" }'`

    # We concatenate each host
    HOSTS="$HOSTS$CURRENT_HOST,"
  done

  # We process the template with handlebars. The sed command will simply remove the
  # trailing comma from the hosts list.
  handlebars --addresses "[$(echo $HOSTS | sed s/,$//)]" < /config/haproxy.cfg.hb > /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg

  # TODO: [CFG] Add the command to restart HAProxy
fi
```

And here we go for the `member-leave.sh` script. The script differs only for the part where
we remove the backend nodes registered via the `member-join.sh`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "Member leave/join script triggered" >> /var/log/serf.log

BACKEND_UNREGISTERED=false

# We iterate over stdin
while read -a values; do
  # We extract the hostname, the ip, the role of each line and the tags
  HOSTNAME=${values[0]}
  HOSTIP=${values[1]}
  HOSTROLE=${values[2]}
  HOSTTAGS=${values[3]}

  # We only remove the backend nodes
  if [[ "$HOSTROLE" == "backend" ]]; then
    echo "Member $SERF_EVENT event received from: $HOSTNAME with role $HOSTROLE" >> /var/log/serf.log

    # We simply remove the file that was used to track the registered node
    rm /nodes/$HOSTNAME

    # We have at least one new node that leave the cluster
    BACKEND_UNREGISTERED=true
  fi
done

# We only update the HAProxy configuration if we have at least a backend that
# left the cluster. The process to generate the HAProxy configuration is the
# same than for the member-join script.
if [[ "$BACKEND_UNREGISTERED" = true ]]; then
  # To build the collection of nodes
  HOSTS=""

  # We iterate over each backend node registered
  for hostfile in $(ls /nodes); do
    # We convert the content of the backend node file to a JSON format: { "host": "<hostname>", "ip": "<ip address>" }
    CURRENT_HOST=`cat /nodes/$hostfile | awk '{ print "{\"host\":\"" $1 "\",\"ip\":\"" $2 "\"}" }'`

    # We concatenate each host
    HOSTS="$HOSTS$CURRENT_HOST,"
  done

  # We process the template with handlebars. The sed command will simply remove the
  # trailing comma from the hosts list.
  handlebars --addresses "[$(echo $HOSTS | sed s/,$//)]" < /config/haproxy.cfg.hb > /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg

  # TODO: [CFG] Add the command to restart HAProxy
fi
```

**Remarks**:

  - The way we keep track the backend nodes is pretty simple and makes
    the assumption there is no concurrency issue with `Serf`. That's
    reasonable enough to get a quite simple solution.

**Cleanup**:

  - In the main configuration file that is used for bootstrapping
    HAProxy the first time when there are no backend nodes, we have
    the list of servers that we used in the first task and the
    previous lab. We can remove the list. So find `TODO: [CFG] Remove
    all the servers` and remove the list of nodes.

  - In [ha/services/ha/run](ha/services/ha/run), we can remove the two lines
    above `TODO: [CFG] Remove the following two lines`.

We need to make sure the image has the folder `/nodes` created. In the
Docker file, replace the `TODO: [CFG] Create the nodes folder` by the
correct instruction to create the `/nodes` folder.

We are ready to build and test our `ha` image. Let's proceed like in
the [previous task](#ttb).  You should provide the same outputs for
the deliverables. Remember that we have moved the file
`/tmp/haproxy.cfg` to `/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` (**keep
track of the config file like in previous step and also the output of
`docker ps` and `docker inspect <container>`**).

You can also get the list of registered nodes from inside the `ha`
container. Simply list the files from the directory `/nodes`.  (**keep
track of the output of the command like the logs in previous tasks**)

Now, use the Docker commands to stop `s1`.

You can connect again to the `ha` container and get the haproxy
configuration file and also the list of backend nodes. Use the
previous command to reach this goal.  (**keep track of the output of
the ls command and the configuration file like the logs in previous
tasks**)

**Deliverables**:

1. Provide the file `/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` generated in
   the `ha` container after each step. Three files are expected.
   
   In addition, provide a log file containing the output of the 
   `docker ps` console and another file (per container) with
   `docker inspect <container>`. Four files are expected.

2. Provide the list of files from the `/nodes` folder inside the `ha` container.
   One file expected with the command output.

3. Provide the configuration file after you stopped one container and
   the list of nodes present in the `/nodes` folder. One file expected
   with the command output. Two files are expected.
   
    In addition, provide a log file containing the output of the 
   `docker ps` console. One file expected.

4. (Optional:) Propose a different approach to manage the list of backend
   nodes. You do not need to implement it. You can also propose your
   own tools or the ones you discovered online. In that case, do not
   forget to cite your references.

### <a name="task-6"></a>Task 6: Make the load balancer automatically reload the new configuration

> Finally, we have all the pieces in place to finish our
  solution. HAProxy will be reconfigured automatically when web app
  nodes are leaving/joining the cluster. We will solve the problems
  you have discussed in [M1 - 3](#M1).  Again, the solution built
  in this lab is only one example of tools and techniques we can use to
  solve this kind of situation. There are several other ways.

The only thing missing now is to make sure the configuration of
HAProxy is up-to-date and taken into account by HAProxy.

We will try to make HAProxy reload his config with minimal
downtime. At the moment, we will replace the line `TODO: [CFG] Replace
this command` in [ha/services/ha/run](ha/services/ha/run) by the
following script part. As usual, take the time to read the comments.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bash

# ##############################################################################
# WARNING
# ##############################################################################
# S6 expects the processes it manages to stop when it sends them a SIGTERM signal.
# The Serf agent does not stop properly when receiving a SIGTERM signal.
#
# Therefore, we need to do some tricks to remedy the situation. We need to
# "simulate" the handling of SIGTERM in the script and send to Serf the signal
# that makes it quit (SIGINT).
#
# Basically we need to do the following:
# 1. Keep track of the process id (PID) of Serf Agent
# 2. Catch the SIGTERM from S6 and send a SIGINT to Serf
# 3. Make sure this shell script will not stop before S6 stops it, but when
#    SIGTERM is sent, we need to stop everything.

# Get the current process ID to avoid killing an unwanted process
pid=$$

# Define a function to kill the Serf process as Serf does not accept SIGTERM. In
# place, we will send a SIGINT signal to the process to stop it correctly.
sigterm() {
  kill -USR1 $pid
}

# Trap the SIGTERM and in place run the function that will kill the process
trap sigterm SIGTERM

# We need to keep track of the PID of HAProxy in a file for the restart process.
# We are forced to do that because the blocking process for S6 is this shell
# script. When we send to S6 a command to restart our process, we will lose
# the value of the variable pid. The pid variable will stay alive until any
# restart or stop from S6.
#
# In the case of a restart we need to keep the HAProxy PID to give it back to
# HAProxy. The comments on the HAProxy command will complete this exaplanation.
if [ -f /var/run/haproxy.pid ]; then
    HANDOFFPID=`cat /var/run/haproxy.pid`
fi

# To kill an old HAProxy and start a new one with minimal outage 
# HAProxy provides the -sf/-st command-line options. With these options 
# one can give the PIDs of currently running HAProxy processes at startup.
# This will start new HAProxy processes and when startup is complete
# it send FINISH or TERMINATE signals to the ones given in the argument. 
#
# The HANDOFFPID keeps track of the PID of HAProxy. We retrieve it from the
# the file we written the last time we (re)started HAProxy.
exec haproxy -f /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg -sf $HANDOFFPID &

# Retrieve the process ID of the command run in background. Doing that, we will
# be able to send the SIGINT signal through the sigterm function we defined
# to replace the SIGTERM.
pid=$!

# And write it to a file to get it on next restart
echo $pid > /var/run/haproxy.pid

# Finally, we wait as S6 launches this shell script. This will simulate
# a foreground process for S6. All that tricky stuff is required because
# we use a process supervisor in a Docker environment. The applications need
# to be adapted for such environments.
wait
```

**Remarks**:

  - In this lab, we do not achieve an HAProxy restart with _zero_
    downtime. You will find an article about that in the references.

**References**:

  - [Stopping HAProxy](http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.6/management.html#4)
  - [Sending signal to Processes](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Sending_signal_to_Processes)
  - [Zero downtime with HAProxy article](http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2015/04/true-zero-downtime-haproxy-reloads.html)

We need to update our `member-join` and `member-leave` scripts to make sure HAProxy
will be restarted when its configuration is modified. For that, in both files, replace
`TODO: [CFG] Add the command to restart HAProxy` by the following command.

```bash
# Send a SIGHUP to the process. It will restart HAProxy
s6-svc -h /var/run/s6/services/ha
```

**References**:

  - [S6 svc doc](http://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-svc.html)

It's time to build and run our images. At this stage, if you try to reach
`http://192.168.42.42`, it will not work. No surprise as we do not start any
backend node. Let's start one container and try to reach the same URL.

You can start the web application nodes. If everything works well, you could
reach your backend application through the load balancer.

And now you can start and stop any number of nodes you want! You will
see the dynamic reconfiguration occurring. Keep in mind that HAProxy
will take few seconds before nodes will be available. The reason is
that HAProxy is not so quick to restart inside the container and your
web application is also taking time to bootstrap. And finally,
depending of the health checks of HAProxy, your web app will not be
available instantly.

Finally, we achieved our goal to build an architecture that is dynamic
and reacts to nodes coming and going!

![Final architecture](assets/img/final-architecture.png)

**Deliverables**:

1. Take a screenshots of the HAProxy stat page showing more than 2 web
   applications running. Additional screenshots are welcome to see a
   sequence of experimentations like shutting down a node and starting
   more nodes.
   
   Also provide the output of `docker ps` in a log file. At least 
   one file is expected. You can provide one output per step of your
   experimentation according to your screenshots.
   
2. Give your own feelings about the final solution. Propose
   improvements or ways to do the things differently. If any, provide
   references to your readings for the improvements.

3. (Optional:) Present a live demo where you add and remove a backend container.


## Windows troubleshooting

It appears that Windows users can encounter a `CRLF` vs. `LF` problem when the repos is cloned without taking care of the ending lines. Therefore, if the ending lines are `CRFL`, it will produce an error message with Docker during the Vagrant provisioning phase:

```bash
... no such file or directory
```

(Take a look to this Docker issue: https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/9066, the last post show the error message).

The error message is not really relevant and difficult to troubleshoot. It seems the problem is caused by the line endings not correctly interpreted by Linux when they are `CRLF` in place of `LF`. The problem is caused by cloning the repos on Windows with a system that will not keep the `LF` in the files.

Fortunatelly, there is a procedure to fix the `CRLF` to `LF` and then be sure Docker will recognize the `*.sh` files.

First, you need to add the file `.gitattributes` file with the following content:

```bash
* text eol=lf
```

This will ask the repos to force the ending lines to `LF` for every text files.

Then, you need to reset your repository. Be sure you do not have **modified** files.

```bash
# Erease all the files in your local repository
git rm --cached -r .

# Restore the files from your local repository and apply the correct ending lines (LF)
git reset --hard
```

Then, you are ready to go. You can provision your Vagrant VM again and start to work peacefully.

There is a link to deeper explanation and procedure about the ending lines written by GitHub: https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/
